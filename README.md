# Brain Stroke Prediction
This is basically a classification problem. The aim of this study is to check how well it can be predicted if patient will have barin stroke based on the available health data such as glucose level, age, gender etc.

We'll check the [data](https://github.com/muscak/Brain-Stroke-Prediction/tree/main/Data) and perform some explanotary data analysis first, then process the data as needed. After preparing the data, we'll evaluate the performance of different algorithms and tune the hyperparameters of the one which is the most promissing. Finally we'll perform a prediction on the test data to check the overall performance of the chosen algorithm.
